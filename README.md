# Overview

The Funky Rocker (FR for short) is a DIY sex rocker.  [The plans are for sale from the designer here for a fair price.](www.funkyrocker.com)  The FR is a nice design, but is definitely designed without much regard to the difficulty in DIY building of it, or in keeping costs down in terms of parts. The original FR plans require a high degree of accuracy in woodworking, which can be extra challenging with the smaller parts. I switched many of the parts to being 3d printed rather then cut from MDF.

## Important Notes

My 3D models are not intended to replace the purchase and use of the original FR plans. You will still need the original plans to make the rest of the parts and to understand the overall assembly of the FR.

The FR plans come in english (imperial) and metric.  I am in the US, and used the english plans as the parts were easier to source.  Consequently my 3d printed parts are based off the english plans.  If you're using the metric FR plans, my parts will probably require some modifications to work.

## Printing suggestions

For reference I printed all the parts on a Bambu P1S in PLA.  Check the readme in each folder for notes about those specific files.  Most of the parts have an obvious side to print towards the bed.  Rounded edges against the bed may not print well unless you allow supports under them.  Otherwise These should print fine without supports, and I would avoid allowing supports into the bolt holes as they can be very difficult to remove.  

For strength, wall count is generally much more effective then infill.  I printed all these parts with a wall count of 6, 20% infill of gyroid or cross hatch.  Consider variable layer height, especially for the handle, as you want the grip portion with small layer lines to make it feel less 3d printed and more comfortable.

I finished the 3d parts with light sanding, then three coats of an automotive "building" type spray primer to mostly fill in the layer lines.
