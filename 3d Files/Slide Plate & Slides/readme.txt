Print 1x IntegratedSlideandLowerSupport and 2x SlidesForIntegrated.  Glue the SlidesforIntegrated onto the bottom of the Integrated Slide. 

 I suggest waiting to glue until you've made the forward lower support, and use that to align the slides during the glue up so that the slides align as expected.
